# ==== Purpose ====
#
# Test various scenarios involved in creation of foreign key (FK)
# when executing CREATE TABLE ... SELECT (DDL_CTAS).
#
# ==== Requirements ====
#
# R1 The behavior of non-atomic DDL_CTAS remains the same
#    with request to create FK.
#
# R2 The behavior of atomic CTAS and request to create FK is rejected if
#    following conditions are true,
#    - SE supports foreign keys.
#    - SE supports atomic DDL.
#    - The binlogging is enabled.
#    - The binlog format is 'row'.
#
# ==== Implementation ====
#
# TC1 The behavior of non-atomic CTAS remains the same
#     with request to create FK.
# 1) Allow creation of FK on table using MyISAM engine. Using rows which
#    violate FK constraint. Make sure that the FK constraint is ignored.
# 2) Allow creation of FK on table using MyISAM engine. Using rows which
#    do not violate FK constraint.
#
# TC2 The behavior of atomic CTAS, with sql_log_bin OFF.
# 1) Attempt to create FK on table using InnoDB engine. Using rows which
#    violate FK constraint. Make sure we get ER_NO_REFERENCED_ROW_2.
# 2) Allow creation of FK on table using InnoDB engine. Using rows which
#    do not violate FK constraint.
#
# TC3 The behavior of CTAS, with sql_log_bin ON and format STATEMENT.
# 1) Attempt to create FK on table using InnoDB engine. Using rows which
#    violate FK constraint. Make sure we get ER_NO_REFERENCED_ROW_2.
# 2) Allow creation of FK on table using InnoDB engine. Using rows which
#    do not violate FK constraint.
#
# TC4 The behavior of CTAS, with sql_log_bin ON and format MIXED.
# 1) Steps are same as TC3 and the behavior too would be same.
#
# TC5 The behavior of CTAS, with sql_log_bin ON and format ROW.
# 1) Attempt to create FK on table using InnoDB engine and using rows which
#    violate FK constraint results in
#    ER_FOREIGN_KEY_WITH_ATOMIC_CREATE_SELECT.
# 2) Attempt to create FK on table using InnoDB engine and using rows which
#    do not violate FK constraint results in
#    ER_FOREIGN_KEY_WITH_ATOMIC_CREATE_SELECT.
# 3) Attempt to create FK on table using InnoDB engine with CREATE TABLE ...
#    START TRANSACTION is rejected with
#    ER_FOREIGN_KEY_WITH_ATOMIC_CREATE_SELECT.
