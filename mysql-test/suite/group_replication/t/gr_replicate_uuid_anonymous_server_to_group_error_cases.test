# ==== Purpose ====
#
# This test checks that the replica parameter ASSIGN_GTIDS_TO_ANONYMOUS_TRANSACTIONS works as
# expected and throws the expected errors while replicating into a Group replication member server
# having the same group_name as the assign_gtids_to_anonymous_transactions_value
#
# ==== Requirements ====
#
# + TC1: **ASSIGN_GTIDS_TO_ANONYMOUS_TRANSACTIONS** expected errors & warning when
#     replicating into a group with same group_name as the assign_gtids_to_anonymous_transactions_value
#
# ==== Implementation ====
#
# See gr_replicate_anonymous_server_to_group_error_cases.inc
#
# ==== References ====
