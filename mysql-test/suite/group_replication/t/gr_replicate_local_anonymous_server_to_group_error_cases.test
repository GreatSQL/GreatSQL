# ==== Purpose ====
#
# This test checks that the replica parameter ASSIGN_GTIDS_TO_ANONYMOUS_TRANSACTIONS = LOCAL
# works as expected and throws the expected errors while replicating into a Group replication
# member server, where group_name will be the server_uuid of the member server
# 
#
# ==== Requirements ====
#
# + TC1: **ASSIGN_GTIDS_TO_ANONYMOUS_TRANSACTIONS** gives expected errors & warning when
#        replicating into a group with same group_name as the server_uuid of the member server
#        into a group with ASSIGN_GTIDS_TO_ANONYMOUS_TRANSACTIONS = LOCAL
#
# ==== Implementation ====
#
# See gr_replicate_anonymous_server_to_group_error_cases.inc
#
# ==== References ====
#
# WL#12819:GTIDs: Replicate from GTID disabled source to GTID enabled replica directly
