Send DDLs from both clients to trigger a deadlock
connection client1;
SET DEBUG_SYNC = 'ndb_global_schema_lock_acquired WAIT_FOR schema_mdl_acquired';
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS test;
connection client2;
SET DEBUG_SYNC = 'mdl_upgrade_lock SIGNAL schema_mdl_acquired';
CREATE TABLE t1 (a int) engine ndb;
# Reap both DDLs and verify that they succeeded after resolving the deadlock
