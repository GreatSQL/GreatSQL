--echo #

# Create couple of connections to mysqld1
connect(client1,127.0.0.1,root,,test,$MYSQLD_PORT_1);
connect(client2,127.0.0.1,root,,test,$MYSQLD_PORT_1);

--echo Send DDLs from both clients to trigger a deadlock

--enable_connect_log
--connection client1
# After acquiring the GSL, this client should wait for
# the other to acquire IX MDL on schema
SET DEBUG_SYNC = 'ndb_global_schema_lock_acquired WAIT_FOR schema_mdl_acquired';

# Send a 'CREATE DATABASE' - this will,
#  1. acquire the GSL
#  2. wait for other client to acquire IX MDL on schema
#  3. continues and attempts to acquire exclusive MDL on schema
--send CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS test

--connection client2
# This should signal the other after acquiring the IX MDL on schema
# Send it right before attempting to upgrade the MDL on table
SET DEBUG_SYNC = 'mdl_upgrade_lock SIGNAL schema_mdl_acquired';

# Send a 'CREATE TABLE' - this will,
#  1. acquire IX MDL on schema
#  2. signal the other client to continue
#  3. attempt to acquire the GSL so that its MDL on table could be upgraded
#  4. Thus triggering a potential deadlock
--send CREATE TABLE t1 (a int) engine ndb

--echo # Reap both DDLs and verify that they succeeded after resolving the deadlock
