================================================================================
|Percona Server| |release|
================================================================================

Following the `alpha release announced earlier
<https://www.percona.com/blog/2018/09/27/announcement-alpha-build-of-percona-server-8-0/>`_,
Percona announces the release candidate of |Percona Server| |release| on
October 31, 2018. Download the latest version from the Percona web site or the
Percona Software Repositories.

This release is based on |MySQL| 8.0.12 and includes all bug fixes in it. It is
a *Release Candidate* quality release and it is not intended for
production. If you want a high quality, Generally Available release, use the
current Stable version (the most recent stable release at the time of writing in
the 5.7 series is 5.7.23-23).

Percona provides completely open-source and free software.

Installation
================================================================================

As this is a release candidate, installation is performed by enabling the
testing repository and installing the software via your package manager.  For
Debian based distributions, see `apt installation instructions
<https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-server/8.0/installation/apt_repo.html>`_;
for RPM based distributions. see `yum installation instructions
<https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-server/8.0/installation/yum_repo.html>`_.
Note that in both cases after installing the current percona-release package,
you’ll need to enable the testing repository in order to install |Percona Server|
for MySQL |release|.  For manual installations, you can download from the
`testing repository directly through our website
<https://www.percona.com/downloads/TESTING/Percona-Server-80-rc1/>`_.
