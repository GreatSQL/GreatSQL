Release Highlights
=================================================

We have integrated a ZenFS RocksDB plugin to Percona Server for MySQL. This
plugin places files on a raw zoned block device (ZBD) using the MyRocks File
System interface. For more information, see :ref:`zenfs`.

The following list are some of the bug fixes for MySQL 8.0.26, provided by Oracle, and included in Percona Server for MySQL:

* :mysqlbug:`104575`: In the PERFORMANCE_SCHEMA.Threads table, the ``srv_purge_thread`` and ``srv_worker_thread`` values are duplicated.
* :mysqlbug:`104387`: When using REGEX comparison, a CHARACTER_SET_MISMATCH error is thrown.
* :mysqlbug:`104576`: Accessing the second index in a partition table with many columns can create a high CPU load.

Deprecated Features
=================================================

The TokuDB Storage Engine was declared deprecated for Percona Server for MySQL. Starting with Percona Server 8.0.26-16, the plugins are available in the binary builds and packages but are disabled. The plugins will be removed from the binary builds and packages in a future version.

New options have been added to enable the plugins if they are needed to migrate the data to another storage engine.

The instructions on how to enable the plugins and more information are available at the beginning of each TokuDB topic.
